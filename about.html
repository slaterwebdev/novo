        <p>We are a small family run studio that believes busy lives can disconnect us from our roots, leaving us feeling unbalanced and worn down. Our hand-poured aromatherapy candles made from natural soy wax are designed to enhance your self-care rituals. So, let the forest scents take you back under the tree canopies to reconnect you with the power of nature.</p>

          <p>Hello, I'm Keely. 
            I'm so glad that you're here!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm the creator and maker behind your Novo candle. I started Novo in summer 2021 from my passion for all things nature, wellbeing and cosy home scents. Growing up in the countryside and roaming around the outdoors has always been prominent within my childhood memories.
          </p> 

          <p>
            From blackberry picking to baking apple pies, the scents I choose are all inspired by those memories. I always struggled to find scents inspired by these memories surrounding nature that also helped with my wellness. That's why Novo was born. These familiar smells help me to stay in the moment and remind me to take care of myself.
